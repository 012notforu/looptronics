# Technical Overview: Coherence Field Theory (CFT) Neural Dynamics

## Core Mathematical Framework
CFT models neural phase fields θ(x,t) using a second-order PDE with coherence dynamics:

∂²θ/∂t² = (1/β)[∇·F + V'(θ)]

Where the coherence field F is:
F = γ∇θ - α∇θ/(|∇θ|²+ε²)^(3/2)

## Energy Conservation
System conserves energy according to:
E = (β/2)(∂θ/∂t)² + α/√(|∇θ|²+ε²) + (γ/2)|∇θ|² + V(θ)

## Key Parameters
- α: Coherence potential strength (well formation)
- β: Inertial resistance (temporal dynamics) 
- γ: Spatial coupling (diffusive interactions)
- ε: Regularization (prevents singularities)

## Neural Phenomena Modeled
- Coherence wells (attention/memory attractors)
- Traveling waves (information propagation)
- Memory competition and consolidation
- Phase transitions and critical points
