# Technical Overview: Looptronics Wave-Based Computation Framework

This document outlines the scientific and computational principles behind the Looptronics framework â€” a dynamic, interactive grid-based system for exploring wave-based computation, frequency feedback, and emergent pattern formation.

## Grid Structure and Core Mechanics

Looptronics is based on a 2D spatial grid (N x N), where each cell evolves over time using numerical approximations of wave physics. The core variables per grid cell are:

- u[i]: Displacement (amplitude) at cell i
- v[i]: Velocity at cell i

The grid evolves over time using the discrete wave equation:

```
u[i] += v[i] * dt
v[i] += (c^2 * Laplacian(u[i]) + damping + feedback + mutation) * dt
```

Where:
- Laplacian(u[i]) is the 2D discrete Laplacian (difference with neighbors)
- damping is local friction/resistance
- feedback is a signal injected based on frequency history
- mutation is random perturbation under certain conditions

## Wave Sources

There are 3 configurable wave sources that inject periodic energy into the grid. Each source includes:

- A (x, y) position
- Frequency (Hz)
- Amplitude
- Active toggle

Their signal is added to their respective grid point as a sinusoidal driver:

```
source[i] = amplitude * sin(2 * pi * frequency * time + phase)
```

## Neighbor Coupling and Laplacian Operator

The discrete Laplacian is calculated with toroidal (wrapping) boundary conditions:

```
Laplacian(u[i]) = (u[left] + u[right] + u[up] + u[down] - 4 * u[i]) / dx^2
```

This drives wave propagation through energy transfer between neighboring cells.

## Feedback via Laplace-Like Analysis

A frequency-domain feedback system continuously analyzes the amplitude history of the central grid region.

Steps:
1. Aggregate historical average amplitudes over a sliding time window.
2. Apply a simplified transform to extract dominant frequency components.
3. Construct a feedback signal composed of these components.
4. Inject this signal globally into the grid.

The transform is not a true Laplace, but serves as a lightweight frequency estimator to inform dynamic feedback.

## Mutation System

Local mutations are triggered probabilistically when amplitude variation across neighbors exceeds a threshold:

```
if average(|u[i] - u[neighbors]|) > threshold:
    u[i] += random(-0.5, 0.5) * mutationStrength
```

This introduces disorder and potential complexity into an otherwise deterministic system.

## Real-Time Metrics and Pattern Analysis

Several real-time metrics are computed:

- Coupling Flux: Measures average Laplacian magnitude across grid
- Friction Loss: Damping contribution from velocity differences
- Mutation Count: Number of triggered local mutations
- Coherence: Degree of global phase alignment
- Pattern Count: Estimates of symmetry/correlation in local patches
- Laplace Feedback Intensity: Amplitude of injected frequency feedback

## Timing Constants

- dt = 0.015: Time step for updates
- dx = 1.0: Grid cell spacing

---

## Limitations

- This is not a formal PDE solver or physical simulation.
- The "Laplace transform" is a real-time approximation for feedback only.
- Mutation is a heuristic device to introduce variation.

## Intended Use

Looptronics is a tool for:

- Studying emergent behavior from wave interaction and mutation
- Visualizing the impact of frequency feedback on spatial dynamics
- Exploring non-standard computing paradigms and symbolic evolution

This system is meant to invite curiosity, critique, and extension â€” not to assert finality. Further experimentation and mathematical validation are encouraged.
