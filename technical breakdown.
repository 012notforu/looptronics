# ðŸ“˜ Technical Overview: Looptronics Wave-Based Computation Framework

This document outlines the scientific and computational principles behind the Looptronics framework â€” a dynamic, interactive grid-based system for exploring wave-based computation, frequency feedback, and emergent pattern formation.

## ðŸ”§ Grid Structure and Core Mechanics

Looptronics is based on a 2D spatial grid (`N x N`), where each cell evolves over time using numerical approximations of wave physics. The core variables per grid cell are:

- `u[i]`: Displacement (amplitude) at cell `i`
- `v[i]`: Velocity at cell `i`

The grid evolves over time using the discrete wave equation:

```text
u[i] += v[i] * dt
v[i] += (cÂ² * âˆ‡Â²u[i] + damping + feedback + mutation) * dt
```

Where:
- `âˆ‡Â²u[i]` is the 2D Laplacian (difference with neighbors)
- `damping` is local friction/resistance
- `feedback` is signal injected based on frequency history
- `mutation` is random perturbation under certain conditions

## ðŸ“¡ Wave Sources

There are 3 configurable wave sources that inject periodic energy into the grid. Each source includes:

- A `(x, y)` position
- Frequency (`Hz`)
- Amplitude
- Active toggle

Their signal is added to their respective grid point as a sinusoidal driver:

```text
source[i] = amplitude * sin(2Ï€ * frequency * time + phase)
```

---

## ðŸŒ Neighbor Coupling and Laplacian Operator

The discrete Laplacian âˆ‡Â² is calculated with toroidal (wrapping) boundary conditions:

```text
âˆ‡Â²u[i] = (u[left] + u[right] + u[up] + u[down] - 4*u[i]) / dxÂ²
```

This drives wave propagation through energy transfer between neighboring cells.

## ðŸŒ€ Feedback via Laplace-Like Analysis

A frequency-domain feedback system continuously analyzes the amplitude history of the central grid region.

Steps:
1. Aggregate historical average amplitudes over a sliding time window.
2. Apply a simplified transform to extract dominant frequency components.
3. Construct a feedback signal composed of these components.
4. Inject this signal globally into the grid.

The transform is *not a true Laplace*, but serves as a lightweight frequency estimator to inform dynamic feedback.

## ðŸ” Mutation System

Local mutations are triggered probabilistically when amplitude variation across neighbors exceeds a threshold:

```text
if mean(|u[i] - u[neighbors]|) > threshold:
    u[i] += random(-0.5, 0.5) * mutationStrength
```

This introduces disorder and potential complexity into an otherwise deterministic system.

## ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Metrics and Pattern Analysis

Several real-time metrics are computed:

- **Coupling Flux**: Measures average Laplacian magnitude across grid
- **Friction Loss**: Damping contribution from velocity differences
- **Mutation Count**: Number of triggered local mutations
- **Coherence**: Degree of global phase alignment
- **Pattern Count**: Estimates of symmetry/correlation in local patches
- **Laplace Feedback Intensity**: Amplitude of injected frequency feedback

## â± Timing Constants

- `dt = 0.015`: Time step for updates
- `dx = 1.0`: Grid cell spacing

---

## âš ï¸ Limitations

- This is not a formal PDE solver or physical simulation.
- The "Laplace transform" is a real-time approximation for feedback only.
- Mutation is a heuristic device to introduce variation.

## ðŸ§ª Intended Use

Looptronics is a tool for:

- Studying emergent behavior from wave interaction + mutation
- Visualizing the impact of frequency feedback on spatial dynamics
- Exploring non-standard computing paradigms and symbolic evolution

This system is meant to invite curiosity, critique, and extension â€” not to assert finality. Further experimentation and mathematical validation are encouraged.
