Wave-Based Symbolic Computation System

This project explores how symbolic patterns can emerge from wave interactions.

- **3-Wave System**: Minimal engine using three symbolic waveforms to evolve a symbolic grid.
- **6-Wave System**: Expanded version with richer interference and symbolic complexity.

Tracks symbolic state, entropy, and expression dynamics over time.  
Not a finalized system — just an open experiment in wave-guided symbolic logic.

Dual-licensed for open research and protected use.

Author Note

I'm not a formal researcher by training—this project is the result of independent exploration and ongoing curiosity about symbolic systems, wave dynamics, and alternative models of computation. I’m sharing it in the hope of connecting with others who may be interested in building on it, stress-testing the ideas, or helping refine the theoretical grounding. If you're a researcher, developer, or just someone curious about unconventional computation, I'd be grateful for any feedback, collaboration, or critique. This has been formed with the massive asistance of ai, cursor, and wolfeam engine.
