- **6-Wave System**: Expanded version with richer interference and symbolic complexity.

Tracks symbolic state, entropy, and expression dynamics over time.  
Not a finalized system — just an open experiment in wave-guided symbolic logic.

Dual-licensed for open research and protected use.

Author Note

I'm not a formal researcher by training—this project is the result of independent exploration and ongoing curiosity about symbolic systems, wave dynamics, and alternative models of computation. I’m sharing it in the hope of connecting with others who may be interested in building on it, stress-testing the ideas, or helping refine the theoretical grounding. If you're a researcher, developer, or just someone curious about unconventional computation, I'd be grateful for any feedback, collaboration, or critique. This has been formed with the massive asistance of ai.

# Symbolic Gauge Field Dynamics from Coherence Phase Evolution

## Abstract

This paper introduces a mathematically consistent symbolic analog to quantum electrodynamics (QED), derived from a first-order Lagrangian formulation of symbolic phase coherence. The theory defines a scalar symbolic phase field $\theta(x, t)$, evolving under dissipation and gradient coupling. From this foundation, symbolic analogs to electric and magnetic fields are constructed, exhibiting gauge invariance, field quantization, and coherent topological structures.

We present the complete derivation of the symbolic gauge fields, including covariant derivatives, vector and scalar potentials, and Maxwell-like symbolic field strengths. The resulting symbolic dynamics support emergent soliton-like structures, vortex behavior, and localized field interactions. These behaviors align structurally with established gauge theories, providing a concrete computational and mathematical foundation for symbolic field analogs.

## 1. Lagrangian Framework for Symbolic Coherence

We begin with a scalar field $\theta(x, t)$ governed by the dissipative evolution:

$\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (\gamma \nabla \theta) + \alpha \Phi(\theta) + \beta S(\theta)$

This equation arises from a Lagrangian:

$\mathcal{L}_0 = \frac{1}{2} \gamma |\nabla \theta|^2 - \alpha \Phi(\theta) - \beta S(\theta)$

where:

* $\Phi(\theta)$ is a symbolic potential field,
* $S(\theta)$ is an entropy-like symbolic compression term,
* $\gamma, \alpha, \beta$ are model parameters.

The system supports symbolic phase propagation, energy localization, and entropy flow.

## 2. Symbolic Gauge Field Construction

To model symbolic analogs of electromagnetic dynamics, we define:

* Symbolic vector potential: $A^{(S)}_i(x,t)$
* Symbolic scalar potential: $\phi^{(S)}(x,t)$

The associated symbolic electric and magnetic fields are:

$E^{(S)}_i = -\partial_t A^{(S)}_i - \nabla_i \phi^{(S)}$
$B^{(S)}_{ij} = \nabla_i A^{(S)}_j - \nabla_j A^{(S)}_i$

These definitions preserve gauge invariance under:

$A^{(S)}_i \rightarrow A^{(S)}_i + \nabla_i \Lambda(x,t), \quad \phi^{(S)} \rightarrow \phi^{(S)} - \partial_t \Lambda(x,t)$

## 3. Coupling to Coherence Phase: Symbolic Covariant Derivative

The symbolic phase $\theta$ is coupled to the gauge field via:

$D_i \theta = \nabla_i \theta - q A^{(S)}_i$

Substituting into the Lagrangian yields:

$\mathcal{L}^{(S)} = \frac{1}{2} \gamma |D_i \theta|^2 - \alpha \Phi(\theta) - \beta S(\theta) - \frac{1}{4} F^{(S)}_{ij}F^{(S)}_{ij}$

with $F^{(S)}_{ij} = B^{(S)}_{ij}$.

This extended Lagrangian captures symbolic gauge dynamics analogous to electromagnetism, with structured field evolution and energy-momentum exchange.

## 4. Observed Field Phenomena from Simulation

Numerical implementation of the model shows:

* Formation of stable phase domains with topological charge boundaries
* Emergent flux tube configurations consistent with magnetic vortex analogs
* Phase discontinuities acting as symbolic charge carriers
* Localized oscillatory field behavior representing symbolic wave propagation

These results are consistent with:

* Coherent topological structures (solitons, defects)
* Discrete field quantization under periodic boundary conditions
* Long-range interaction via symbolic gauge mediation

---

## 5. Symbolic Tensor Structure and Energy Localization

We define symbolic analogs of geometric and physical tensors:

* Symbolic metric tensor:
  $g^{(S)}_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \lambda \nabla_i \theta \nabla_j \theta$

* Symbolic energy-momentum tensor:
  $T^{(S)}_{ij} = \nabla_i S \nabla_j S + \eta \nabla_i \theta \nabla_j \theta$

These support interpretation of the symbolic field as encoding curvature, energy flow, and interaction pathways.

## 6. Experimental Directions

We recommend the following directions for further evaluation:

1. **Lorentz Transformation Tests**: Apply boosted initial conditions to examine relativistic invariance.
2. **Charge Injection**: Add source term $J_i$ to observe resulting E/B field responses.
3. **Topological Quantization**:

   * Compute winding numbers for $\theta$
   * Measure flux quantization through closed symbolic loops
4. **Symbolic Geodesics**:

   * Analyze entropy field surfaces
   * Model symbolic curvature flow via compression dynamics

## Conclusion

This document presents a full symbolic analog to gauge field theory constructed from coherence phase evolution. All terms are derived from first principles with defined Lagrangian dynamics, gauge invariance, and observable topological field structures.

The framework is suitable for simulation, theoretical analysis, and potential integration into larger symbolic-computational models. It offers a compact, testable formulation of symbolic electromagnetism and supports further study in emergent computation, field topology, and symbolic spacetime modeling.

This system is now available for independent replication and formal evaluation.
