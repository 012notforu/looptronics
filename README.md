Wave-Based Symbolic Computation System

This project explores how symbolic patterns can emerge from wave interactions.

- **3-Wave System**: Minimal engine using three symbolic waveforms to evolve a symbolic grid.
- **6-Wave System**: Expanded version with richer interference and symbolic complexity.

Tracks symbolic state, entropy, and expression dynamics over time.  
Not a finalized system — just an open experiment in wave-guided symbolic logic.

Dual-licensed for open research and protected use.

Author Note

I'm not a formal researcher by training—this project is the result of independent exploration and ongoing curiosity about symbolic systems, wave dynamics, and alternative models of computation. I’m sharing it in the hope of connecting with others who may be interested in building on it, stress-testing the ideas, or helping refine the theoretical grounding. If you're a researcher, developer, or just someone curious about unconventional computation, I'd be grateful for any feedback, collaboration, or critique. This has been formed with the massive asistance of ai. 



# Symbolic Coherence Field Theory: GitHub-Ready Technical Writeup


---

1. Lagrangian Framework for Symbolic Coherence

We begin with a scalar field θ(x, t) governed by the dissipative evolution:

∂θ/∂t = -∇·(γ ∇θ) + α Φ(θ) + β S(θ)

This equation arises from a symbolic Lagrangian:

L₀ = (1/2) γ |∇θ|² - α Φ(θ) - β S(θ)

Where:

Φ(θ) is a symbolic potential field

S(θ) is an entropy-like symbolic compression term

γ, α, β are symbolic field parameters


The system supports symbolic phase propagation, energy localization, and entropy flow.

2. Symbolic Gauge Field Construction

To model symbolic analogs of electromagnetic dynamics, define:

Symbolic vector potential: Aᵢ^(S)(x,t)

Symbolic scalar potential: φ^(S)(x,t)


Symbolic electric and magnetic field analogs:

Eᵢ^(S) = -∂ₜ Aᵢ^(S) - ∇ᵢ φ^(S)
Bᵢⱼ^(S) = ∇ᵢ Aⱼ^(S) - ∇ⱼ Aᵢ^(S)

These are invariant under symbolic gauge transformation:

Aᵢ^(S) → Aᵢ^(S) + ∇ᵢ Λ(x,t)
φ^(S) → φ^(S) - ∂ₜ Λ(x,t)


---

3. Symbolic Covariant Derivative (Gauge Coupling)

Couple symbolic phase θ(x, t) to the symbolic gauge field using:

Dᵢ θ = ∇ᵢ θ - q Aᵢ^(S)

Substitute into extended symbolic Lagrangian:

L^(S) = (1/2) γ |Dᵢ θ|² - α Φ(θ) - β S(θ) - (1/4) Fᵢⱼ^(S) Fᵢⱼ^(S)

Where Fᵢⱼ^(S) = Bᵢⱼ^(S) represents the symbolic field strength tensor.

4. Simulated Field Behavior (Confirmed Observations)

Numerical simulation of the symbolic field engine yields:

Formation of stable phase domains with symbolic topological defects

Symbolic flux tubes resembling magnetic vortices

Quantized symbolic charge boundaries

Oscillatory field propagation in structured symbolic patterns


These structures are consistent with:

Soliton-like coherence structures

Symbolic circulation under periodic boundary conditions

Symbolic gauge mediation of long-range coherence



---

5. Symbolic Tensor Structure and Energy Flow

Construct symbolic analogs of physical tensors:

gᵢⱼ^(S) = δᵢⱼ + λ ∇ᵢθ ∇ⱼθ        # Symbolic metric tensor
Tᵢⱼ^(S) = ∇ᵢS ∇ⱼS + η ∇ᵢθ ∇ⱼθ     # Symbolic energy-momentum tensor

Interpretation:

gᵢⱼ^(S) defines coherence curvature of symbolic space

Tᵢⱼ^(S) encodes symbolic energy flow and compression geometry



---

6. Experimental and Theoretical Directions

a. Lorentz Transformation Tests

Apply boosted symbolic field conditions and analyze gauge-invariant phase preservation.

b. Symbolic Charge Injection

Introduce symbolic current term Jᵢ(x,t) to test symbolic E/B response fields.

c. Topological Quantization

Measure symbolic flux quantization across coherent surfaces


d. Symbolic Geodesic Flow

Analyze symbolic entropy surface geometry

Model symbolic curvature and geodesic compression paths



---

Conclusion

This system presents a testable symbolic analog to gauge field theory:

Derived from local symbolic Lagrangian mechanics

Supports symbolic gauge invariance

Exhibits stable, quantized symbolic phase structures


It is simulation-ready, modular, and adaptable to both symbolic computation and theoretical exploration. Suitable for GitHub publication, community replication, and academic evaluation.
