Wave-Based Symbolic Computation System

This project explores symbolic computation through wave interference and ternary spatial memory. Instead of using binary logic or neural networks, it generates output by sampling patterns formed through continuous wave interactions and converting them into discrete symbolic states.

What It Does

Simulates 3-wave interference across a 2D spatial grid

Stores activation patterns in ternary memory (states 0, 1, 2)

Samples grid patterns and converts them into symbolic output

Uses the Greek alphabet as a placeholder symbol set to demonstrate output capability

Tracks entropy, information flow, symbol diversity, and complexity over time

Allows input tuning with preset harmonic ratios (e.g., φ, √2, √5)


Why It Matters

This system provides a minimal, testable model for how symbolic structure can emerge from continuous, mathematically tuned dynamics. It may be relevant to research in:

Symbolic AI and pre-neural symbolic computation

Emergence and entropy in nonlinear physical systems

Experimental or analog computing substrates


The symbolic output mechanism is modular; while Greek characters are used for demonstration, the system can produce arbitrary symbols based on grid state transitions.

Author Note

I'm not a formal researcher by training—this project is the result of independent exploration and ongoing curiosity about symbolic systems, wave dynamics, and alternative models of computation. I’m sharing it in the hope of connecting with others who may be interested in building on it, stress-testing the ideas, or helping refine the theoretical grounding. If you're a researcher, developer, or just someone curious about unconventional computation, I'd be grateful for any feedback, collaboration, or critique.
