# Solutions to the Coherence Field Equation

## The Full CFT Equation
```
∂²θ/∂t² = (1/β) [ ∇·(γ∇θ - α∇θ / (|∇θ|² + ε²)^(3/2) ) + V'(θ) ]
```

This is a **highly nonlinear wave equation**. Exact solutions exist only in special cases, but we can find key behaviors and approximations.

## I. Expanding the Divergence Term

```
∇·(γ∇θ - α∇θ / (|∇θ|² + ε²)^(3/2)) = γ∇²θ - ∇·(f∇θ)
```

where `f = α/(|∇θ|² + ε²)^(3/2)`

Using the product rule:
```
∇·(f∇θ) = f∇²θ + ∇f·∇θ
```

Therefore:
```
∂²θ/∂t² = (1/β)[γ∇²θ - f∇²θ - ∇f·∇θ + V'(θ)]
         = (1/β)[(γ - f)∇²θ - ∇f·∇θ + V'(θ)]
```

## II. Key Limiting Cases

### A. Small Gradient Approximation (|∇θ| << ε)

When gradients are small:
```
f ≈ α/ε³   (approximately constant)
∇f ≈ 0
```

The equation becomes:
```
∂²θ/∂t² ≈ (1/β)[(γ - α/ε³)∇²θ + V'(θ)]
```

**This is a linear wave equation!**

**Solution for V(θ) = 0:**
```
θ(x,t) = A cos(kx - ωt + φ)
```

where the dispersion relation is:
```
ω² = (1/β)(γ - α/ε³)k²
```

**Critical insight**: If α/ε³ > γ, then ω² < 0 → **unstable modes**!
The system is **inherently unstable** near perfect coherence.

### B. Large Gradient Approximation (|∇θ| >> ε)

When gradients are large:
```
f ≈ α/|∇θ|³
∇f ≈ -3α∇θ/|∇θ|⁵
```

The equation becomes:
```
∂²θ/∂t² ≈ (1/β)[(γ - α/|∇θ|³)∇²θ + 3α(∇θ·∇θ)/|∇θ|⁵ + V'(θ)]
```

For large gradients, α/|∇θ|³ → 0, so:
```
∂²θ/∂t² ≈ (1/β)[γ∇²θ + V'(θ)]
```

**This recovers standard scalar field theory in the large gradient limit.**

## III. 1D Solutions

For θ = θ(x,t), the equation simplifies:

```
∂²θ/∂t² = (1/β)[(γ - α/(θₓ² + ε²)^(3/2))∂²θ/∂x² - 3ααθₓθₓₓ/(θₓ² + ε²)^(5/2) + V'(θ)]
```

where θₓ = ∂θ/∂x, θₓₓ = ∂²θ/∂x²

### Static Solutions (∂θ/∂t = 0)

```
0 = (γ - α/(θₓ² + ε²)^(3/2))θₓₓ - 3ααθₓ²θₓₓ/(θₓ² + ε²)^(5/2) + V'(θ)
```

**Special case: V(θ) = 0**
```
θₓₓ[(γ - α/(θₓ² + ε²)^(3/2)) - 3ααθₓ²/(θₓ² + ε²)^(5/2)] = 0
```

Either θₓₓ = 0 (linear solutions) or the bracket equals zero.

## IV. Spherically Symmetric Solutions

For θ = θ(r,t) in spherical coordinates:

```
∇²θ = ∂²θ/∂r² + (2/r)∂θ/∂r
|∇θ|² = (∂θ/∂r)²
```

The equation becomes:
```
∂²θ/∂t² = (1/β)[(γ - α/((∂θ/∂r)² + ε²)^(3/2))(∂²θ/∂r² + (2/r)∂θ/∂r) 
                  - 3α(∂θ/∂r)(∂²θ/∂r²)/((∂θ/∂r)² + ε²)^(5/2) + V'(θ)]
```

### Black Hole Analogue (Static, θ = θ(r))

```
0 = (γ - α/((θ'(r))² + ε²)^(3/2))(θ''(r) + (2/r)θ'(r)) 
    - 3αθ'(r)θ''(r)/((θ'(r))² + ε²)^(5/2) + V'(θ)
```

**Event horizon condition**: θ'(r) → 0 as r → r_h

At the horizon: γ - α/ε³ ≈ 0, so:
```
r_h ≈ (2γε³/α)^(1/2)
```

## V. Traveling Wave Solutions

Seek solutions of the form θ(x,t) = F(x - ct) where c is the wave speed.

Let ξ = x - ct, then:
```
c²F''(ξ) = (1/β)[(γ - α/((F'(ξ))² + ε²)^(3/2))F''(ξ) 
                  - 3αF'(ξ)(F''(ξ))/((F'(ξ))² + ε²)^(5/2) + V'(F)]
```

Rearranging:
```
F''(ξ)[βc² - γ + α/((F'(ξ))² + ε²)^(3/2) + 3α(F'(ξ))²/((F'(ξ))² + ε²)^(5/2)] = V'(F)
```

## VI. Linearization Around Equilibrium

For small perturbations θ = θ₀ + δθ around equilibrium θ₀:

If ∇θ₀ = 0 (uniform background):
```
∂²(δθ)/∂t² ≈ (1/β)[(γ - α/ε³)∇²(δθ) + V''(θ₀)δθ]
```

**This gives the characteristic frequency:**
```
ω² = (1/β)[(γ - α/ε³)k² + V''(θ₀)]
```

**Stability condition**: γ > α/ε³ for stable oscillations.

## VII. Energy Conservation

The energy density is:
```
E = (β/2)(∂θ/∂t)² + α/√(|∇θ|² + ε²) + (γ/2)|∇θ|² + V(θ)
```

**Conservation law**: ∂E/∂t + ∇·J = 0

where the energy flux is:
```
J = -(∂θ/∂t)[γ∇θ - α∇θ/(|∇θ|² + ε²)^(3/2)]
```

## VIII. Numerical Solutions Required

For general solutions, we need numerical methods:

1. **Finite difference schemes** for the PDE
2. **Spectral methods** for periodic boundary conditions  
3. **Adaptive mesh refinement** near singular regions
4. **Conservation-preserving algorithms** to maintain energy

## IX. Key Physical Insights

1. **Instability**: System is unstable when α/ε³ > γ
2. **Wave propagation**: Two different speeds for small/large gradients
3. **Black holes**: Natural solutions with vanishing gradients
4. **Energy conservation**: Exact conservation law exists
5. **Coherence wells**: System actively avoids ∇θ = 0 states
